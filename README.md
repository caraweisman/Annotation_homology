This Github contains a summary of the results of the homology searches performed in Weisman et al 2021, conducted as described in the Methods section. These data underlie Figures 1-3. 

There is one folder per species group considered in the paper (4).

Each species group folder contains 10 files: one for each of the 10 annotations used in the study (5 species, 2 annotations each). 

Each annotation's file contains one row per protein in the annotation and one column per annotation in the species group (again, 10). 

The entry in each row represents whether the homology search found a significantly similar protein in the annotation indicated by the column: a 1 indicates yes, and a 0 indicates no. 

The sources for the annotations and a link to download the annotations can be found in Table 1 of the paper.
