This Github contains the results of the homology search, conducted as described in the Methods section, performed in Weisman et al 2021. These results underlie Figures 1-3. 
There is one folder per species group used in the paper. 
Each species group folder contains 10 files: one for each of the 10 annotations used in the study (5 species, 2 annotations each). 
Each annotation's file contains one row per protein in the annotation and one column per annotation in the species group (again, 10). 
The entry in each row represents whether the homology search found a significantly similar protein in the annotation indicated by the column: a 1 indicates yes, and a 0 indicates no.
